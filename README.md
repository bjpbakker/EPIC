# EPIC: Erik Protocol Implementation Concept

## Getting Started

You need the rust toolchain (rustc and cargo) installed. Then build and run.

```
# cargo build
# cargo test
# cargo run
```

You can use the `erik_fetch` tool to interact with an ERIK relay.

```
# cargo run --bin erik_fetch -- --fqdn <fqdn> --server <erik-relay> index
```
